# Welcome to my GitHub page repository!

I intend to use this repository as a place to host my front-end developments.
I will eventually create a formal portfolio, but in the meantime, this will serve as a placeholder to links of some of my works.

## Front-end practice

In this directory, you will find the source code to some webpages that I have implemented based on .PSD files that I found online. 
Links to the original work will be included in both the source and on this readme.
