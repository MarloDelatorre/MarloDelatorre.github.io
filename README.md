# Welcome to my GitHub page repository!

I intend to use this repository as a place to host my front-end developments.
I will eventually create a formal portfolio, but in the meantime, this will serve as a placeholder to links of some of my works.

## Front-end practice

In this directory, you will find the source code to some webpages that I have implemented based on .PSD files that I found online. 
Links to the original work will be included in both the source and on this readme.
These sites are made to be responsive, so try resizing your window or going into developer tools to see.
